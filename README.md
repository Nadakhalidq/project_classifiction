# Fetal Health for Classification Project
Project idea: Studying the condition of the fetus in the motherâ€™s womb to diagnose its health status (normal, abnormal) based on several measured factors such as its heart rate, movement rate, slowing rate of fetal movement for a long time, and others to predict its health status, whether it is normal or abnormal. In this project, we created a model to classify Fetus health.
